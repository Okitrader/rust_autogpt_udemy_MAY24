Rust & AutoGPT Mastery: From Basics to AI-driven Code Automation
Welcome to the Rust & AutoGPT Mastery course repository! This course is designed to take you from a beginner in Rust programming to a skilled developer capable of leveraging GPT-4 (ChatGPT) to create an AutoGPT system. This system will not only write any code you like but also test, improve, and rewrite it as necessary. Begin your journey by building a robust web server using the Actix Web framework and advance to crafting AI functions that structure precise responses from large language models (LLMs).
